# Enterprise Linux Lab Report: 01-lamp

- Student name: Jens Van Liefferinge
- Github repo: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/elnx-1920-sme-JensVL>

Installing & configuring a LAMP stack on pu001.

## Test plan

1. On the host system, go to the local working directory of the project repository.
2. Execute `vagrant status`.
    - There should be one VM, `pu001` with status `not created`. If the VM does exist, destroy it first with `vagrant destroy -f pu001`.
3. Execute `vagrant up pu001`.
    - The command should run without errors (exit status 0).
4. Log in on the server with `vagrant ssh pu001` and run the acceptance tests. They should succeed:

```console
    Running test /vagrant/test/common.bats
    ✓ SELinux should be set to 'Enforcing'
    ✓ Firewall should be enabled and running
    ✓ EPEL repository should be available
    ✓ Bash-completion should have been installed
    ✓ bind-utils should have been installed
    ✓ Git should have been installed
    ✓ Nano should have been installed
    ✓ Tree should have been installed
    ✓ Vim-enhanced should have been installed
    ✓ Wget should have been installed
    ✓ Admin user jens should exist
    ✓ An SSH key should have been installed for jens
    - Custom /etc/motd should have been installed (skipped)

    13 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped
    Running test /vagrant/test/pu001/lamp.bats
    ✓ The necessary packages should be installed
    ✓ The Apache service should be running
    ✓ The Apache service should be started at boot
    ✓ The MariaDB service should be running
    ✓ The MariaDB service should be started at boot
    ✓ The SELinux status should be ‘enforcing’
    ✓ Web traffic should pass through the firewall
    ✓ Mariadb should have a database for Wordpress
    ✓ The MariaDB user should have write
    ✓ The website should be accessible through HTTP
    ✓ The website should be accessible through HTTPS
    ✓ The certificate should not be the default one
    ✓ The Wordpress install page should be visible under http://192.0.2.10/wordpress/
    ✓ MariaDB should not have a test database
    ✓ MariaDB should not have anonymous users

    15 tests, 0 failures
```

Manual workaround for when the "MariaDB user should have write" test fails:

- SSH into pu001 using `vagrant ssh pu001`.
- Run `mysql -u root -p` to log in as root user.
- Enter `root` as password.
- Eexecute `grant all privileges on *.* to user1@localhost identified by 'password' with grant option;`.
- Exit out of the MariaDB shell using `exit`.
- Try to log in with the user: `mysql -u user1 -p`.
- Enter `password` as password.
- If successful, you should see the MariaDB prompt.

5. On the host sytem, browse to `https://192.0.2.10`.
6. An Apache welcome page should be visible.
7. On the host system, browse to `htps://192.0.2.10/wordpress`.
8. A wordpress install page should be visible.

26. Finished test plan
27. Wrote test report

### Update 22/11

MariaDB user sometimes doesn't have write options by default anymore for some reason. The test results will say so too. Tried to fix:

- using another [role](https://github.com/CarlosLongarela/ansible-role-mariadb)
- double checking variables from the bertvv.mariadb role
- adding `GRANT` permission into variable

without success.

**Manual workaround:**

- SSH into pu001 using `vagrant ssh pu001`.
- Run `mysql -u root -p` to log in as root user.
- Enter `root` as password.
- Execute `grant all privileges on *.* to user1@localhost identified by 'password' with grant option;`.
- Exit out of the MariaDB shell using `exit`.
- Try to log in with the user: `mysql -u user1 -p`.
- Enter `password` as password.
- If successful, you should see the MariaDB prompt.
- The test will now succeed.
