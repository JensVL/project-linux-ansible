# Enterprise Linux Lab Report

- Student name: Jens Van Liefferinge
- Github repo: <https://github.com/HoGentTIN/elnx-1920-sme-JensVL>

Setting up a master and slave DNS server for the `avalon.lan` domain.

## Test plan

1. On the host system, go to the local working directory of the project repository.
2. Execute `vagrant status`.
3. The VMs with the names `pr001` and `pr002` should not exist. If the VMs do exist, destroy them first with `vagrant destroy -f pr001` and `vagrant destroy -f pr002`.
4. Execute `vagrant up pr001 pr002` to launch both DNS servers.
    - The command should run without errors (exit status 0).
5. Log in on the master DNS server with `vagrant ssh pr001` and run the acceptance tests using `sudo /vagrant/test/runbats.sh`. They should succeed:

```console
Running test /vagrant/test/common.bats
 ✓ SELinux should be set to 'Enforcing'
 ✓ Firewall should be enabled and running
 ✓ EPEL repository should be available
 ✓ Bash-completion should have been installed
 ✓ bind-utils should have been installed
 ✓ Git should have been installed
 ✓ Nano should have been installed
 ✓ Tree should have been installed
 ✓ Vim-enhanced should have been installed
 ✓ Wget should have been installed
 ✓ Admin user jens should exist
 ✓ An SSH key should have been installed for jens
 - Custom /etc/motd should have been installed (skipped)

13 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped
Running test /vagrant/test/pr001/masterdns.bats
 ✓ The dig command should be installed
 ✓ The main config file should be syntactically correct
 ✓ The forward zone file should be syntactically correct
 ✓ The reverse zone files should be syntactically correct
 ✓ The service should be running
 ✓ Forward lookups public servers
 ✓ Forward lookups private servers
 ✓ Reverse lookups public servers
 ✓ Reverse lookups private servers
 ✓ Alias lookups public servers
 ✓ Alias lookups private servers
 ✓ NS record lookup
 ✓ Mail server lookup

13 tests, 0 failures
```

6. Exit out of the SSH session using `exit`.
7. Log in on the slave DNS server with `vagrant ssh pr002` and run the acceptance tests using `sudo /vagrant/test/runbats.sh`. They should succeed:

```console
Running test /vagrant/test/common.bats
 ✓ SELinux should be set to 'Enforcing'
 ✓ Firewall should be enabled and running
 ✓ EPEL repository should be available
 ✓ Bash-completion should have been installed
 ✓ bind-utils should have been installed
 ✓ Git should have been installed
 ✓ Nano should have been installed
 ✓ Tree should have been installed
 ✓ Vim-enhanced should have been installed
 ✓ Wget should have been installed
 ✓ Admin user jens should exist
 ✓ An SSH key should have been installed for jens
 - Custom /etc/motd should have been installed (skipped)

13 tests, 0 failures, 1 skipped
Running test /vagrant/test/pr002/slavedns.bats
 ✓ The dig command should be installed
 ✓ The main config file should be syntactically correct
 ✓ The server should be set up as a slave
 ✓ The server should forward requests to the master server
 ✓ There should not be a forward zone file
 ✓ The service should be running
 ✓ Forward lookups public servers
 ✓ Forward lookups private servers
 ✓ Reverse lookups public servers
 ✓ Reverse lookups private servers
 ✓ Alias lookups public servers
 ✓ Alias lookups private servers
 ✓ NS record lookup
 ✓ Mail server lookup

14 tests, 0 failures
```

8. Verify Fail2ban is running by executing the following command: `systemctl status fail2ban`. Status should be active (running).

11. Added `networks` into slave dns configuration as per [commit](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-bind/commit/1df9f2c409335fbe0c07ad4997c27d656a9e3061)
12. Tests still failing
13. Double checked syntax, copied configuration from [example](https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-bind)
14. Tests still failing
15. Added `bind_forwarders` into slave configuration
16. Tests still failing

19. Added Fail2Ban role to every server
20. Commented Fail2ban because it takes a long time to provision

22. Merge DNS configuration into one file
23. Tests still failing
